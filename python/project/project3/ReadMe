-----------------------------------------------------------------
Game Introduce:

Have Fun!(*^▽^*)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Advantage:
    Very Good Music!!!
    Very Cool Plane and Background!! (Materials from the Internet)
    Increases in difficulty over time!
    The difficulty of the game can be changed with code!
    Sprites were used to create Gif!!
    Object-oriented programming!

Deficiency:
    1. The Sprite's built-in collision detection is confusing.
        I'm very precise about the size of the pattern, but it's always crash at a long distance.
    2. Add game icon
        !!!!I don't know why I add icon can cause this little game's frames not stable (っ°Д°;)っ!!!!
    3. I want add more enemy type and it's life bar, but it is a lot work to do. (>-<)
